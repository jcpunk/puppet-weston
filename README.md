## Description

Weston itself isn't hard to manage. However, setting up workable remote desktop sessions under systemd can be tricky.

This module offers some classes to make this easier, with the complication that it is very prescriptive and opinionated about how this is done.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

You will need weston in an available package repo.

### Beginning with weston

To install the weston desktop, just include the `weston` module.

## Usage

### VNC Desktops
Include usage examples for common use cases in the **Usage** section. Show your
users how to use your module to solve problems, and be sure to include code
examples. Include three to five examples of the most important or common tasks a
user can accomplish with your module. Show users how to accomplish more complex
tasks that involve different types, classes, and functions working in tandem.

## Limitations

In the Limitations section, list any incompatibilities, known issues, or other
warnings.

## Development
